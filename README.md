## Brief Description
Code used in the Data Mining exam.

## Full Description
In our data mining exam pratical part we are given the task to analyze a given dataset in about 2 hours,
we can bring code scripts material from home. 
The core of the course is about the variance-bias trade-off, some simple models are used to conduct the analysis.

### Main folder
Where all the scripts are.

### test_dataset
(support function only)
Some toy dataset created (and their creation script) to test each function.

### template_report
(support function only)
italian libre office templates for the final report.

## How to use it

### General
1) Start with the preprocessing_script: eventually change base parameters and change the names of the file you want to read.
By default this makes two folders where imoportant figures and fitted models are saved (in case the software suddenly stop working).
Also, at the preprocessing end the resulting dataframe and some important objects are saved in the main folder.
2) Based on the particular problem open one of the scripts and conduct the analys.

## Warning
This is code is made thinking of the exam constraints (both computing power and time) so it's didactical in it's nature.
Please, be critical in the case you have intetions to use it in your analys
